# phototime
A tool by Michael Haephrati for changing the date and time stamp of photos.

Michael Haephrati looked for photos and videos of an important event and couldn't understand why he can't find any video files, even though he recalled that his wife and his daughter took both photos and videos...

He then realized that his still camera (Nikon D5000) and camcorder (Sony) are both set up with the wrong date and time, each with a different wrong time... One was 7 hours and 36 minutes earlier and the other was 3 hours later. That was the reason for the confusion, and he spent a lot of time checking backups, etc. thinking his precious files were somehow deleted. He calculated the correct times of both video and photo files, adjusting their time stamp and happily found out that both occurred within the same time frame, so everything was OK. He then wrote this software
